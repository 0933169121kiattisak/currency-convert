# The key concepts of this project appear to be:
1. Building a currency conversion app using Next.
2. Fetching real-time exchange rates from an API and displaying the converted amount.
3. Handling errors and providing fallback exchange rates.
4. Providing a responsive and user-friendly interface with currency selection options.
5. Demonstrating state management and reactive updates in a React component.
